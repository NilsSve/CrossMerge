CrossMerge is a data synchronization tool that simplifies connecting different databases to update their data.

With CrossMerge you can virtually connect any software package that uses a database with another database within a couple of minutes. There's no need to make any modifications to the database structures. No programming is needed.

Use the CrossMerge Builder to point and click to connect database table pairs (Source and Target), then run the CrossMerge Engine to update your data! The CrossMerge Engine can be scheduled to run at specific times with e.g. Windows Scheduled Tasks.
